Steps (very similiar to a private assembly)
- Right click on the references and pick Add Reference
- Click Browse and navigate to the bin/Debug of the SharedPhotoAlbum Component (SharedPhotoAlbum.dll) and select the dll
- Go to properties of the reference and set local copy to false (this is the purpose of a shared assembly - one place for all, not local)
- Put in the Using PhotoAlbum; at the top and your in business.

- you can note the properties of the reference 
	strong name = true
	local copy = false

Deployment
-copy files
-install server into GAC (gacutil /i or drag and drop)
